# PyScheme [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rodrigosetti/pyscheme.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rodrigosetti/pyscheme)

Yet another scheme implementation in Python. This one is very minimalistic and
used for education only.

## Features

 * Lazy-evaluation
 * Tail-call optimization
 * Very minimalistic: (almost) everything that can be built with procedures and
   macros is out.
